- Internet connection to access TensorFlow.js and other libraries
- Microsoft PowerBI Desktop (optional, for enhanced data visualization)

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/current-plus-esg.git
   cd current-plus-esg
   ```

2. **Configure your ThingSpeak API credentials**
   Edit `js/main.js` and update the ThingSpeak configuration:
   ```javascript
   const CONFIG = {
     thingspeak: {
       channelID: "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID",
       readAPIKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       fieldMap: {
         energyUsage: "field1", // Update according to your channel setup
         voltage: "field2",
         current: "field3"
       },
       refreshInterval: 30000, // 30 seconds
     },
     // ... other config
   };
   ```

3. **Launch the application**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser
   - For development with hot-reloading, use a local server:
     ```bash
     npx http-server -o
     ```

## üîß Customization

### Adjusting Carbon Emission Calculation

The default carbon emission factor is set to 0.71 kg CO‚ÇÇ per kWh. You can adjust this value in the `CONFIG` object in `js/main.js` based on your location's energy mix.

```javascript
carbonFactor: 0.71, // kg CO‚ÇÇ per kWh - adjust based on your location
```

### Modifying Report Templates

ESG report templates can be customized in `js/report-generator.js`. You can modify the sections, content, and styling to meet your organizational reporting needs.

### Adding Custom AI Models

For advanced users, you can train and implement custom TensorFlow.js models by modifying the `js/ai-model.js` file. The application is designed to be easily extended with new prediction capabilities.

## üìä Data Visualization

The dashboard includes various data visualization components using Chart.js:

- **Energy Consumption Trend**: Track usage patterns over time
- **Carbon Emissions Analysis**: Monitor your carbon footprint
- **ESG Score Breakdown**: Visualize performance across E, S, and G categories
- **AI Prediction Charts**: View forecasted sustainability metrics

### PowerBI Integration

1. Navigate to the Analytics page
2. Click "Export to PowerBI" button
3. Open the downloaded JSON file in PowerBI Desktop
4. Create custom dashboards or use our provided templates

## üå± Sustainability Insights

The AI model provides several types of sustainability insights:

1. **Sustainability Score**: Overall ESG performance metric (0-100)
2. **Carbon Forecast**: Predicted future carbon emissions
3. **Energy Efficiency Score**: Evaluation of energy usage efficiency 
4. **Targeted Recommendations**: Specific actions to improve sustainability

## üìÑ Report Generation

Generate comprehensive ESG reports with customizable options:

- Include/exclude AI predictions
- Include/exclude data visualizations
- Include/exclude sustainability recommendations
- Professional PDF formatting with company branding
- Export data to PowerBI for interactive reports

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling and Reliability Features

The platform includes several advanced error handling and reliability features:

### 1. DOM Safe Utility

A utility to safely handle DOM operations and prevent "Cannot read properties of null" errors:

- Safe element selection with built-in error handling
- Protected methods for manipulating text, HTML, classes, and styles
- Automatic fallbacks when elements are not found

### 2. ThingSpeak Helper

A robust helper for ThingSpeak API interactions:

- Multiple layers of defensive coding against null elements
- Proper initialization with DOM-ready checks
- Error recovery and detailed logging for API interactions
- Fallback mechanisms for critical functions

### 3. AI Model Fallback System

A reliability system for AI-related operations:

- Automatic failover when the primary model encounters errors
- Status tracking for both primary and fallback models
- Configurable retry logic with progressive backoff

### 4. Global Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling throughout the application:

- Global catch for all JavaScript errors, including null reference errors
- Unhandled promise rejection handling
- Safe DOM manipulation utilities for the entire application
